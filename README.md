This Group Project is for a photographer- Sarah Smith.
It showcases her beautiful and clean looking website.
This project was carried out by Alero, Hannah and Favour.
We all worked on the Home page(Index.html).The page included texts, images, an image gallery and Call to Action Buttons.
Alero worked on the Portfolio page with help from Hannah to get pictures that would fit the aesthetic of the site.
Hannah worked on the About page that showed Sarah's story as well how to contact her through a button that leads to the Contact page.
Favour worked on the Contact page that shows how Sarah can be reached.
All pages are responsive with links working and directing to the right places.
