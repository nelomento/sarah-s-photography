        <H3> Hello, Iâ€™m Sarah, a London-based photographer and I specialise in portrait photography.</H3>
        <p> My dad gifted me my first camera when I was 9 years old because he saw how much I enjoyed taking pictures with my mum's digital camera. Now, 20 years later what started as a hobbie and passion of mine has turned into a full-time career.</p>
        <p>After completing my degree in film and photography, I worked part-time at an art gallery and continued to build my portfolio by using my family and friends, and that's what made me fall in love with portrait photography. I really enjoy being able to capture the essence of a person through my lens and telling a story through my work.</p>
        <p>Since branching out and starting my own business, I have worked with so many people from all walks of life. It has been an absolute joy to capture so many wonderful people, so I hope I can add you to the list - let's work together! </p>
        <p>Contact me: 02078908900 or drop me a message.</p>
